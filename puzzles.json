These units are intricately linked by principles like Ohm's Law and the electrical power formula. Hertz, while an SI unit named after a scientist, measures frequency, which describes the rate of a periodic phenomenon or signal, rather than an intrinsic property or interaction within the circuit itself like the others.",
